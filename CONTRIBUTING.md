## New to Gym Wallet?

If you're new, it is a good idea to first get acquainted with the idea behind GYM Wallet and the point of view from a
user perspective. Our **landing page** is a good place to start.

## What about non-code contributions?

Those are at least as important as code contributions: Help on our Discord, answers on Stack Overflow, Wiki page edits, examples... We very much
appreciate those. However, this document is specifically about contributing
code.
