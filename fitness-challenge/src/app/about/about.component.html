        <h1>Overview</h1>

        <p>Cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin have set off a tsunami of innovation mostly impacting finance.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Itâ€™s only a matter of time before cryptocurrencies impact health, fitness and sports.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Health insurers will begin rewarding customers with cryptocurrencies for living active and healthy
            lifestyles. Athletes salaries will be paid out in cryptocurrencies. Funds raised from 5k races will be paid
            out to charities in cryptocurrencies.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            We believe that sports can be the catalyst to the mass adoption of this technology and that it can become
            the foundation for a new paradigm in preventative healthcare.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            We aim to build the infrastructure that will support this future.
